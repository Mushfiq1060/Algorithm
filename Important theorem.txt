1. Bezouts identity -> Let a and b be integers with greatest common divisor d. 
   Then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = d. More generally, the 
   integers of the form ax + by are exactly the multiples of d. If ax+by+cz......+nk=d
   then we can write that gcd(a,b,c,.....,k)=d.
   
   
2. a+b = (a ^ b) + 2 * (a & b) --> ^ (xor)

3. a+b = (a|b) + (a&b)

4. (sum of x contiguous element)%x==0
